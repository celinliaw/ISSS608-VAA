# 6.1 Learning Outcome

Gain hands on experience using:

-   ggstatsplot: to create visual graphics with rich statistical information

-   performance package to visualise model diagnostics

# 6.2 Visual Statistical Analysis with ggstatsplot

[**ggstatsplot**]{.underline} is an extension of ggplot 2 package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests

# 6.3 Getting Started

## 6.3.1 Installing and Launching R Packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggstatsplot)
```

## 6.3.2 Importing Data

Importing Exam.csv data using tidyverse packages

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("Exam_data.csv")
```

## 6.3.3 One-sample test: gghistostats() method

In the code chunk below, gghistostats() is used to build an visual of one-sample test on English scores.

::: panel-tabset
### The Plot

```{r}
#| echo: false
set.seed(1234)

gghistostats(
  data = exam,
  x = ENGLISH,
  type = "bayes",
  test.value = 60,
  xlab = "English scores"
)

```

### The Code

```{r}
#| eval: false
set.seed(1234)

gghistostats(
  data = exam,
  x = ENGLISH,
  type = "bayes",
  test.value = 60,
  xlab = "English scores"
)
```
:::

**Explanation of the Results:**

Ho: The mean english score is 60

H1: The mean english score is not equals to 60

-   **log₁₀(BF₀₁) = -31.45**\
    This is the logarithm of the Bayes Factor **in favor of the alternative hypothesis** over the null:

    This is **extreme evidence** in favor of the **alternative hypothesis**.

-   **posterior difference = 7.16**\
    The estimated mean difference between the observed group and a comparison value (likely a hypothesized mean like 0 or 50), with the observed average English score being significantly higher.

-   **CI⁹⁵% \[5.54, 8.75\] (ETI)**\
    This is the **95% credible interval** (Equal-Tail Interval), suggesting that the true mean difference is very likely between 5.54 and 8.75.

-   **JZS Cauchy = 0.71**\
    This is the **scale parameter** for the Cauchy prior distribution used in the Bayesian t-test (Jeffreys–Zellner–Siow prior), controlling the expected effect size.

-   **Dashed Blue Line (x = 74.74)**\
    This shows the **sample mean** of the English scores. The peak at this point suggests most scores cluster around here.

## 6.3.4 Unpacking the Bayes Factor

-   Bayes Factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It is a measure of strength of evidence in favor of one theory among 2 competing theories

-   It gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis based on external information and tells us the weight of evidence is in favor of the hypothesis

-   Bayes factor is often written as B10 and can be defined mathematically as"

-   The [Schwarz criterion](https://www.statisticshowto.com/bayesian-information-criterion/) is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor

## 6.3.5 How to interpret Bayes Factor

It can be any positive number and can be interpreted in the table below:

## 6.3.6 Two-sample mean test: ggbetweenstats()

The code <code style="color: purple;">ggbetweenstats()</code> is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Math scores by gender.

```{R}
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = GENDER, 
  y = MATHS,
  type = "np",
  messages = FALSE
)
```

**Summary of results from plot:**

**Ho: The distribution of the math scores is the same for male and female students**

**H1: The distribution of the math scores is not the same for male and female students**

-   **Test used:** `W_Mann–Whitney = 13011.00`\
    This is a non-parametric alternative to the t-test (used when data may not be normally distributed).

-   **p-value = 0.91 (\> 0.05)**\
    ➤ This is **not statistically significant**. A high p-value (much greater than 0.05) suggests **no evidence** to reject the null hypothesis.\
    In other words, **there is no significant difference in Maths scores between males and females**.

-   **Median (Female) = 74**, **Median (Male) = 75**\
    ➤ Scores are nearly identical in central tendency.

-   **Rank biserial correlation = 0.007**\
    ➤ This is a **very small effect size**, indicating negligible practical difference.

-   **95% CI = \[−0.12, 0.13\]**\
    ➤ The confidence interval for the effect size includes 0, further confirming that **there's no meaningful difference**

-   **n = 322**\
    ➤ Total number of observations (170 females, 152 males).

## 6.3.7 Oneway ANOVA Test: ggbetweenstats() method

The code <code style="color: purple;">ggbetweenstats()</code> is used to build a visual for one-way ANOVA test on English score by race.

-   "ns" - only non-significant

-   "s" - only significant

-   "all" - everything

```{R}
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = RACE, 
  y = ENGLISH,
  type = "p",
  mean.ci = TRUE, 
  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, 
  pairwise.display = "s",
  p.adjust.method = "fdr",
  messages = FALSE
)
```

**Summary of results from plot:**

-   **Welch’s ANOVA**:

F(3,23.8)=10.15,p=1.71×10−4F(3, 23.8) = 10.15,\quad p = 1.71 \times 10\^{-4}F(3,23.8)=10.15,p=1.71×10−4

➤ The **p-value is very small**, indicating a **statistically significant difference** in English scores among the racial groups.

-   **Effect size (ω²) = 0.50**\
    ➤ This is a **very large effect**, suggesting race explains a substantial proportion of variance in English scores.

-   **CI₉₅% \[0.21, 1.00\]** for ω²\
    ➤ Confirms the effect size is meaningful.

-   **n = 322**\
    ➤ Sample size (with group sizes shown under each violin).

-   **p (FDR-adjusted) = 5.19e-06**\
    ➤ Adjusted p-value from Games–Howell pairwise comparisons — confirms at least one pairwise difference is significant.

## 6.3.8 Significant Test of Correlation: ggscatterstats()

In the code chunk below, [ggscatterstats()](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggscatterstats.html) is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.

```{r}
ggscatterstats(
  data = exam,
  x = MATHS,
  y = ENGLISH,
  marginal = TRUE, #Change this to FALSE to turn off bar charts
  )
```

**Summary of results from plot:**

-   **Pearson correlation** ​=0.83:\
    ➤ This indicates a **very strong positive correlation** — students who score well in Maths tend to also score well in English.

-   **p-value = 1.70e-83**\
    ➤ This is an extremely small p-value, so the correlation is **highly statistically significant**.

-   **95% CI for** r: \[0.79, 0.86\]\
    ➤ The confidence interval confirms the correlation is both strong and precise.

-   **t(320) = 26.72**\
    ➤ The test statistic for evaluating correlation; much larger than typical critical values.

-   **n = 322 pairs**\
    ➤ Total number of students with both scores available.

## 6.3.9 Significant Test of Association (Dependence): ggbarstats() methods

In the code chunk below, the Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using [cut()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/cut).

```{r}
exam1 <- exam %>% 
  mutate(MATHS_bins = 
           cut(MATHS, 
               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))
)
```

In this code chunk below [ggbarstats](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbarstats.html) is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association.

```{r}
ggbarstats(exam1, 
           x = MATHS_bins, 
           y = GENDER)
```

**Summary of results from plot:**

-   **Chi-squared test** χPearson2(3)=1.04, p=0.79\chi\^2\_{\text{Pearson}}(3) = 1.04, p = 0.79χPearson2​(3)=1.04, p=0.79\
    ➤ **Not statistically significant**, meaning there's **no evidence** of an association between gender and Maths score bins.

-   **Cramér's V = 0.00**, with **95% CI \[0.00, 0.08\]**\
    ➤ **Effect size is negligible**. There is no practical difference between the two gender groups in how their Maths scores are distributed.

-   **Sample size** n = 322:\
    170 females and 152 males
