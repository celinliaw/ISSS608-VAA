Overview\n\n## 1.1 Setting the scene\n\nA local online media company that publishes daily content on digital platforms is planning to release an article on demographic structures and distribution of Singapore in 2024.\n\n## 1.2 The Task\n\nAssuming the role of the graphical editor of the media company, you are tasked to prepare at most three data visualization for the article.\n\nTo accomplish the task, the data: *Singapore Residents by Planning Area/Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2024* dataset shared by [Department of Statistics, Singapore(DOS)](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/latest-data) is used.\n\n## 1.3 Breaking down the question\n\nBased on these information, the following questions will be answered:\n\n-   What is the proportion of males and females in Singapore and is gender-balance consistent across Singapore?\n-   What is the age distribution of Singapore's population in 2024 and is there a decrease in birth rates over the years?\n-   Is the current number of working adults enough to support the number of dependents in Singapore?\n\n# 2. Getting Started\n\n## 2.1 Load packages\n\nThe following packages are loaded using the <code style=\"color: blue;\">pacman::p_load</code> function:\n\n-   **tidyverse:** Core collection of R packages designed for data science\n\n-   **ggrepel:** An R package to provide geoms for gg plot2 to repel overlapping text labels\n\n-   **ggthemes:** An R package to provided extra themes, geoms and scales for ggplot 2\n\n-   **hrbrthemes:** an R packagae that provides typography-centric themes and theme componenets for ggplot2\n\n-   **patchwork:** to prepare composite figure created using ggplot2\n\n-   **dplyr:** An R package that provides a grammar of data manipulation, offering a set of functions for filtering, selecting, mutating, summarising and arranging data frames\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggrepel, \n               ggthemes,  hrbrthemes,\n               patchwork, dplyr) \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## 2.2 Import Data\n\nThe data that has been used has been mentioned in Chapter 1.2 above. This dataset will be imported as *resident_data.*\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresident_data <- read_csv(\"respopagesex2024.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## 2.3 Data Wrangling\n\n### 2.3.1 Check for duplicate entries\n\nThe data is being checked for any duplicate entries using <code style=\"color: blue;\">any(duplicated())</code>.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nany(duplicated(resident_data))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSince \"FALSE\" is returned, there are no duplicated entries\n\n### 2.3.2 Check for missing values\n\nThe <code style=\"color: blue;\">colSums</code> function is being used to check for missing values.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolSums(is.na(resident_data))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  PA   SZ  Age  Sex  Pop Time \n   0    0    0    0    0    0 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThere are no missing values in any of the rows.\n\n### 2.3.3 Filtering for relevant variables & renaming them\n\nThere are 60424 rows x 6 columns in the data, where the columns are labelled as:\n\n-   **PA** - Planning Area\n\n-   **SZ** - Subzone\n\n-   **Age** - From \"0\" to \"89\", and those above 90 are labelled as \"90_and_Over\"\n\n-   **Sex** - Males or Females\n\n-   **Pop** - Resident Count (Has been rounded to the nearest 10)\n\n-   **Time** - Year (We will only be looking at 2024 data)\n\nA new object called **resident_data_clean** is created where it will rename **PA, SZ** and **Pop** for easy reading by using the <code style=\"color: blue;\">rename()</code> function.\n\nThose labelled as \"90_and_Over\" in the Age Column will be renamed as \"90\" using the <code style=\"color: blue;\">ifelse()</code> function for easier data plots.\n\nPopulation and age will then be categorised as numerical data by using the <code style=\"color: blue;\">as.numeric</code> function.\n\nFor the Age column, it is slightly special as <code style=\"color: blue;\">levels = as.character</code> function in R sorts alphabetically by default and \"10\" will come before \"2\". By using this function, R will be forced to treat the ages in true numeric order when plotting or tabulating them. A new column, **Age_numeric**, was also created in the new object.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresident_data_clean <- resident_data %>%\n  rename(\n    Planning_Area = PA,\n    Subzone = SZ,\n    Population = Pop\n  ) %>%\n  # Convert Age to \"90+\" if it's \"90_and_Over\"\n  mutate(\n    Age = ifelse(Age == \"90_and_Over\", \"90\", Age),\n    Population = as.numeric(Population),\n    Age = factor(Age, levels = as.character(0:90)),\n    Age_numeric = as.numeric(as.character(Age))  \n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### 2.3.4 Grouping them into Regions for Easy Visualization\n\nAs there are too many planning areas, to make things easier to visualize, the planning areas have been further categorised into 5 areas: North, North-East, East, West and Central. This was done by using the categories on the [Urban Redevelopment Authority(URA)](https://eservice.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=MP) website:\n\n-   **North**: Central Water Catchment, Lim Chu Kang, Mandai, Sembawang, Simpang, Sungei Kadut, Woodlands, Yishun\n\n-   **North-East**: Ang Mo Kio, Hougang, Punggol, Sengkang, Serangoon, Seletar\n\n-   **East**: Bedok, Changi, Changi Bay, Pasir Ris, Paya Lebar, Tampines\n\n-   **West**: Boon Lay, Bukit Batok, Bukit Panjang, Choa Chu Kang, Clementi, Jurong East, Jurong West, Pioneer, Tengah, Tuas, Western Water Cachement\n\n-   **Central**: Bishan, Bukit Merah, Bukit Timah, Central Area, Downtown Core, Marina East, Marina South, Museum, Newton, Novena, Orchard, Outram, River Valley, Rochor, Singapore River, Straits View, Tanglin\n\n    Areas like **North-Eastern Islands** and **Western islands** were intentionally left out as they do not belong to any of the areas\n\n**Steps:**\n\n**Step 1:** A new list called **region_map** was created to categorise them into the 5 categories\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# 1.

Data Visualization\n\n## 3.1 Pie Chart By Regions\n\nFirst, groups were being created using <code style=\"color: blue;\">groupby()</code> to group them by regions and sex (Eg. East Males and East Females) so that the total population of each group can be found using <code style=\"color: blue;\">sum()</code>. After that, <code style=\"color: blue;\">.groups = \"drop\"</code> will remove the groups as ggplot doesn't use groupings to plot and some functions that \"mutate\" may not turn out as expected.\n\nNext, <code style=\"color: blue;\">ordered_levels</code> was created to define the stacking order for the pie slices in an anti-clockwise direction.\n\n<code style=\"color: blue;\">mutate()</code> was used to add new columns to the pie_all_regions object.\n\n<code style=\"color: blue;\">ggplot()</code> initializes a ggplot and the factors **y = Population** defines the height of each bar to be turned into pie slices and **fill = RegionSex** means the colour fill will be based on Sex.\n\n<code style=\"color: blue;\">geom_col</code> draws bars with heights corresponding to population with **width of 1** and **white borders between pie slices.**\n\n<code style=\"color: blue;\">geom_text</code> was used to add percentage labels inside each pie slice with **size of 3** and **text colour black.**\n\n<code style=\"color: blue;\">coord_polar(theta = \"y\")</code> converts stacked bar into a circular pie chart where the y-axis becomes the angle.\n\n<code style=\"color: blue;\">labs()</code> help to add chart title and legend title.\n\n<code style=\"color: blue;\">scale_fill_manual</code> was used to set custom colours for each Region-Sex.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### The Plot\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-Home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### The Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Summarise population by Region and Sex\npie_all_regions <- resident_regioned %>%\n  group_by(Region, Sex) %>%\n  summarise(Population = sum(Population), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n\n# Define the correct stacking order for pie slices\nordered_levels <- c(\n  \"Central.Males\", \"Central.Females\",\n  \"East.Males\", \"East.Females\",\n  \"North.Males\", \"North.Females\",\n  \"North-East.Males\", \"North-East.Females\",\n  \"West.Males\", \"West.Females\"\n)\n\n# Prepare the data\npie_all_regions <- pie_all_regions %>%\n  mutate(\n    RegionSex = factor(paste(Region, Sex, sep = \".\"), levels = ordered_levels),\n    label = paste0(round(Population / sum(Population) * 100, 1), \"%\")\n  )\n\n# Plot: simple, clean pie with percentages inside\nggplot(pie_all_regions, aes(x = \"\", y = Population, fill = RegionSex)) +\n  geom_col(width = 1, color = \"white\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = label),\n    position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"black\"\n  ) +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Population Composition by Region and Gender (2024)\",\n    fill = \"Region & Sex\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"Central.Males\"     = \"#f4cccc\",\n      \"Central.Females\"   = \"#a94442\",\n      \"East.Males\"        = \"#d9ead3\",\n      \"East.Females\"      = \"#6aa84f\",\n      \"North.Males\"       = \"#fce5cd\",\n      \"North.Females\"     = \"#e69138\",\n      \"North-East.Males\"  = \"#d9d2e9\",\n      \"North-East.Females\"= \"#8e7cc3\",\n      \"West.Males\"        = \"#cfe2f3\",\n      \"West.Females\"      = \"#3c78d8\"\n    ),\n    breaks = rev(ordered_levels)\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n***Observations***: From the pie chart, it can be seen that the **proportion of males and females in each area is quite similar**, only differing by 1-2%.

We can then conclude that there are **slightly less males than females in Singapore**. Overall, gender balance is consistent across Singapore.\n\nAdditionally, the **West and North-East Areas each made up 25%** of the total population, accounting for half the population in Singapore while the **North, Central and and East made up of the other half** of Singapore's population.\n\n## 3.2 Age-Sex Pyramid by Regions\n\nFor the age-sex pyramid, the data was then mutated using <code style=\"color: blue;\">cut()</code> and <code style=\"color: blue;\">breaks()</code> function to split them into Age categories: \"0-9\", \"10-19\" and so on. In the <code style=\"color: blue;\">cut()</code> function, \"right = FALSE\" was used to exclude the upper bound of the bins so that they will consider 0-9 instead of 0-10 for each bin.

Conclusion\n\nIn this exercise, data cleaning and visualization of data was performed to examine the relationship between Age, Gender, Region and Population in Singapore. The key findings are:\n\n-   There is **gender-balance consistency across Singapore** with **slightly less males** than females **in all Regions** of Singapore\n\n-   There are **more males than females** in the **Age Range 0 to 29**, except in the Central Area\n\n-   There is consistently **more population in the Age Range 30 to 69** as compared to **Age Range 0 to 29**, showing a decrease in birth rate in Singapore\n\n-   There is a good average ratio of **1 dependent to 2 working adults** in Singapore, showing a healthy demographic\n\nTo conclude, Singapore has a balanced gender ratio with healthy dependency structure across the regions. However, a smaller proportion of young residents means a declining birth rate. If this trend continues, it may lead to a rising dependency in the future and policies should be adjusted for ageing related needs. Overall, current demographics reflect stability but call for forward looking strategies.\n\nWith relation to the codes used for analysis, **ggplot2** is a powerful package for exploratory data analysis when paired with **dplyr** which allows mutation of the data to usable formats. The original dataset consists of many areas which makes it difficult to find a direction and thus was further categorised into subgroups using the dplyr functions. Additional functions like **geom_col, geom_text, coord_flip, coord_cartesian and coor_polar** were further utilised to create the visualizations for visual analysis.\n\nOverall, this task was helpful to practice how to use R to mutate data and to present data effectively, conveying a clear message for the results obtained.\n\n# 5.
