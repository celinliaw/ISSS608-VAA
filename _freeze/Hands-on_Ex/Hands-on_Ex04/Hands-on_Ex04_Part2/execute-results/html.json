The peak at this point suggests most scores cluster around here.\n\n## 6.3.4 Unpacking the Bayes Factor\n\n-   Bayes Factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It is a measure of strength of evidence in favor of one theory among 2 competing theories\n\n-   It gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis based on external information and tells us the weight of evidence is in favor of the hypothesis\n\n-   Bayes factor is often written as B10 and can be defined mathematically as\"\n\n![](images/clipboard-4142434025.png)\n\n-   The [Schwarz criterion](https://www.statisticshowto.com/bayesian-information-criterion/) is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough approximation of the Bayes Factor\n\n## 6.3.5 How to interpret Bayes Factor\n\nIt can be any positive number and can be interpreted in the table below:\n\n![](images/clipboard-116261035.png)\n\n## 6.3.6 Two-sample mean test: ggbetweenstats()\n\nThe code <code style=\"color: purple;\">ggbetweenstats()</code> is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Math scores by gender.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER, \n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Hands-on_Ex04_Part2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n**Summary of results from plot:**\n\n-   **Test used:** `W_Mann–Whitney = 13011.00`\\\n    This is a non-parametric alternative to the t-test (used when data may not be normally distributed).\n\n-   **p-value = 0.91**\\\n    ➤ This is **not statistically significant**.
